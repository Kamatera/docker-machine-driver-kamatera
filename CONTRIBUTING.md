# Contributing to docker-machine-driver-kamatera

* Welcome to Kamatera!
* Contributions of any kind are welcome.

## Building from source

Use an up-to-date version of [Go](https://golang.org/dl) and [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)

To use the driver, you can download the sources and build it locally:

```shell
# Get sources and build the binary at ~/go/bin/docker-machine-driver-kamatera
$ go get github.com/OriHoch/docker-machine-driver-kamatera

# Make the binary accessible to docker-machine
$ export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)
$ export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
$ export PATH="$PATH:$GOBIN"
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/OriHoch/docker-machine-driver-kamatera
$ dep ensure
$ go build -o docker-machine-driver-kamatera
$ cp docker-machine-driver-kamatera /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-kamatera
```

## Development

Fork this repository, yielding `github.com/<yourAccount>/docker-machine-driver-kamatera`.

```shell
# Get the sources of your fork and build it locally
$ go get github.com/<yourAccount>/docker-machine-driver-kamatera

# * This integrates your fork into the $GOPATH (typically pointing at ~/go)
# * Your sources are at $GOPATH/src/github.com/<yourAccount>/docker-machine-driver-kamatera
# * That folder is a local Git repository. You can pull, commit and push from there.
# * The binary will typically be at $GOPATH/bin/docker-machine-driver-kamatera
# * In the source directory $GOPATH/src/github.com/<yourAccount>/docker-machine-driver-kamatera
#   you may use go get to re-build the binary.
# * Note: when you build the driver from different repositories, e.g. from your fork
#   as well as github.com/OriHoch/docker-machine-driver-kamatera,
#   the binary files generated by these builds are all called the same
#   and will hence override each other.

# Make the binary accessible to docker-machine
$ export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)
$ export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
$ export PATH="$PATH:$GOBIN"

# Make docker-machine output help including kamatera-specific options
$ docker-machine create --driver kamatera
```
